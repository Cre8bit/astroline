# BVH Implementation Summary

## What We've Done

1. **Installed and configured three-mesh-bvh** - Already installed version 0.9.1
2. **Applied BVH acceleration to raycasting** - Using `acceleratedRaycast` from three-mesh-bvh
3. **Initialized BVH on BufferGeometry prototype** - Added computeBoundsTree and disposeBoundsTree methods
4. **Applied BVH to loaded models** - Both original and cloned models get BVH computed
5. **Added performance monitoring** - Tracking raycast times and cache hit rates
6. **Enhanced debug visualization** - Surface raycasting and normals can be visualized

## How to Verify BVH is Working

### 1. Check Browser Console

When you load the page, you should see:

- "âœ“ BVH methods initialized on BufferGeometry prototype"
- "=== Testing BVH Setup ===" with test results
- "Model loaded and BVH applied: [path]" for each loaded model
- "BVH applied to X meshes" messages

### 2. Performance Monitoring

- Check the HUD in the top-left corner showing "BVH: X.XXms | Cache: XX.X%"
- Look for console logs every 5 seconds showing BVH performance stats
- Lower raycast times indicate BVH is working

### 3. Debug Visualization

Press these keys to toggle debug visualizations:

- `S` - Surface raycasting rays (green)
- `N` - Surface normals (red)
- `G` - Gravity debug visualization
- `H` - Direction debug visualization

### 4. Manual Verification

Open browser console and run:

```javascript
// Check if BVH is applied to the moon
console.log("Moon object:", window.moon1?.object);
window.moon1?.object.traverse((child) => {
  if (child.geometry) {
    console.log("Geometry has BVH:", !!child.geometry.boundsTree);
  }
});
```

## Key Performance Indicators

1. **Raycast Time**: With BVH, complex geometry should raycast in <1ms
2. **Cache Hit Rate**: Should be >50% for repeated surface queries
3. **FPS**: Should remain stable even with multiple entities on complex surfaces

## Common Issues

1. **TypeScript Errors**: These are type-checking issues but don't affect runtime
2. **BVH Not Applied**: Check console for "BVH applied to X meshes" messages
3. **No Performance Gain**: Ensure the mesh has sufficient complexity (>1000 vertices)

## Files Modified

- `src/main.ts` - Added BVH initialization and testing
- `src/core/bvhInit.ts` - BVH prototype initialization
- `src/core/modelLoader.ts` - Automatic BVH application to models
- `src/core/surfaceConstraintsManager.ts` - Enhanced with BVH raycasting and performance tracking
- `src/utils/bvhTest.ts` - BVH testing utilities
- `tsconfig.json` - Fixed TypeScript configuration for Three.js
- `src/vite-env.d.ts` - Added BVH type definitions

## Next Steps

1. Monitor performance in browser console
2. Test with more complex models for greater BVH benefits
3. Add more entities to stress-test the performance improvements
4. Consider using BVH for other collision detection beyond surface constraints
